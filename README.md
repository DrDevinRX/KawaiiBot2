# Kawaii Bot 2

Kawaii Bot replacement for NieR Speedrunning Discord

On launch, the bot will ask for a token and the prefix (default = "-").
It will store it in the file `conf.json`.
You can reconfigure your token and prefix from there.

You can also run the program with a path to a config file, which it will then use.

# Known problems/issues

This bot requires priveleged intents (I'm not sure which ones) in order to use most of the anime reaction commands that include another member.
